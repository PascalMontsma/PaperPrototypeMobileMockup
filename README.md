# PaperPrototypeMobileMockup
A wooden Mobile Mockup I made for paper prototyping. Its a beta version to research and test the needs I have for my quick and dirty prototyping. its an addition to the paper template that I have put on a GitHub repository. You can download the lasercutting file yourself and give it try.
